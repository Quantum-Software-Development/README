## Introduction

Welcome to the exploration of the Torus and its applications in quantum magnetic fields. This repository is dedicated to understanding the intricate relationship between the toroidal shape and magnetic fields in various contexts, from the microcosmic scale of quantum physics to the macrocosmic scale of astrophysics.


## Important Note

We encourage collaboration and discussion on these fascinating topics. If you have any questions or contributions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Torus [Mathematically Speaking:](https://github.com/Quantum-Software-Development/README/blob/de863aea73ea56558093652acb707ef038f17217/torus_pgfplots_package.tex)

The torus is a doughnut-shaped surface in three-dimensional space, described by the following parametric equations:

<br>

$$\color{DodgerBlue} \large \begin{align*}
x(\theta, \phi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \cos \phi \\
y(\theta, \phi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \sin \phi \\
z(\theta, \phi) &= r \sin \theta
\end{align*}$$

<br>

where:

- $\( \theta \)$ and \( \phi \) are angles that trace the surface of the torus,
- $\( R \)$ is the distance from the center of the torus' tube to the center of the torus,
- \( r \) is the radius of the tube itself.

## Quantum Magnetic Field

The torus is a fundamental shape in the study of quantum magnetic fields. This section delves into the creation and dissolution of a torus energy field, exploring how the toroidal geometry plays a crucial role in magnetic confinement and quantum field theory.

## Multimedia Content

<br>

Included in this repository is a video file `Creation.and.dissolution.of.a.torus.energy.field.mp4` that provides a visual representation of the concepts discussed.

<br>

## Torus Code

<br>

This repository also includes code that demonstrates the generation of a Torus in a programming environment. The code is a practical representation of the parametric equations of the Torus and allows users to visualize and interact with the toroidal shape.

<br>

## Python Code Example to Generate a Torus

<br>

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the parameters for the torus
R = 1  # Major radius
r = 0.4  # Minor radius

# Create a mesh grid for the angles
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)

# Parametric equations for the torus
X = (R + r * np.cos(theta)) * np.cos(phi)
Y = (R + r * np.cos(theta)) * np.sin(phi)
Z = r * np.sin(theta)

# Create the figure and 3D axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the surface with color mapping
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=5, cstride=5, cmap='coolwarm', edgecolor='none')

# Set the limits of the plot
ax.set_xlim([-2, 2])
ax.set_ylim([-2, 2])
ax.set_zlim([-2, 2])

# Set the viewpoint
ax.view_init(elev=20, azim=30)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

<br>

## Code Explanation

<br>

The code provided is a Python script that generates a three-dimensional plot of a torus using the matplotlib library.

<br>

## Step-by-Step explanation of what each part of the code does:

<br>

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
```

  <br>

These lines import the necessary libraries:

- numpy for numerical operations,
  
- matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs,
  
- mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for 3D plotting capabilities.


  <br>

  

  <br>
  

```python
# Defining the parametric equations of the Torus
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)
R, r = 2, 1  # Set the major radius (R) and minor radius (r)
```

<br>

Here, theta and phi are arrays of angles used to parameterize the torus. np.linspace creates evenly spaced values between 0 and (2\pi). np.meshgrid generates coordinate matrices from these arrays. R and r are the major and minor radii of the torus, respectively.

<br>

```python
X = (R + r * np.cos(phi)) * np.cos(theta)
Y = (R + r * np.cos(phi)) * np.sin(theta)
Z = r * np.sin(phi)
```

These lines calculate the 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) of the torus using the parametric equations.

 <br>

```python
# Plotting the Torus
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, color='b', rstride=5, cstride=5, alpha=0.7)
```
<br>

The plot_surface function is used to plot the surface of the torus. The color parameter sets the color of the torus, rstride and cstride set the stride used to sample the input data to reduce the number of plotted points, and alpha sets the transparency level.

<br>

```python
# Displaying the graph
plt.show()
```

Finally, plt.show() displays the plot with the torus on the screen.

This script is a practical application of mathematical concepts in computer graphics and can be used for educational purposes or in simulations that require a visual representation of a torus. I
This code will generate a 3D plot of a torus with a color map that transitions between blue and pink, similar to the image you provided. You can adjust the elev and azim parameters in ax.view_init to change the viewpoint. The cmap parameter in plot_surface is set to ‚Äòcoolwarm‚Äô, which is a colormap that includes shades of blue and pink. f you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to open a pull request and ask
