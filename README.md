<br>

## Introduction

Welcome to the exploration of the Torus and its applications in quantum magnetic fields. This repository is dedicated to understanding the intricate relationship between the toroidal shape and magnetic fields in various contexts, from the microcosmic scale of quantum physics to the macrocosmic scale of astrophysics.


## Important Note

We encourage collaboration and discussion on these fascinating topics. If you have any questions or contributions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Torus [Mathematically Speaking:](https://github.com/Quantum-Software-Development/README/blob/de863aea73ea56558093652acb707ef038f17217/torus_pgfplots_package.tex)

The torus is a doughnut-shaped surface in three-dimensional space, described by the following parametric equations:

<br>

$$\color{lightblue} \large \begin{align*}
x(\theta, \phi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \cos \phi \\
y(\theta, \phi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \sin \phi \\
z(\theta, \phi) &= r \sin \theta
\end{align*}$$

<br>

where:

- $\( \theta \)$ and \( \phi \) are angles that trace the surface of the torus,
- $\( R \)$ is the distance from the center of the torus' tube to the center of the torus,
- \( r \) is the radius of the tube itself.

## Quantum Magnetic Field

The torus is a fundamental shape in the study of quantum magnetic fields. This section delves into the creation and dissolution of a torus energy field, exploring how the toroidal geometry plays a crucial role in magnetic confinement and quantum field theory.

## Multimedia Content

<br>

Included in this repository is a video file `Creation.and.dissolution.of.a.torus.energy.field.mp4` that provides a visual representation of the concepts discussed.

## Torus Code

This repository also includes code that demonstrates the generation of a Torus in a programming environment. The code is a practical representation of the parametric equations of the Torus and allows users to visualize and interact with the toroidal shape.

## Python Code Example to Generate a Torus

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Defining the parametric equations of the Torus
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)
R, r = 2, 1  # Set the **major radius (R)** and **minor radius (r)**
X = (R + r * np.cos(phi)) * np.cos(theta)
Y = (R + r * np.cos(phi)) * np.sin(theta)
Z = r * np.sin(phi)

# Creating the figure and 3D axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plotting the Torus
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, color='b', rstride=5, cstride=5, alpha=0.7)

# Displaying the graph
plt.show()
